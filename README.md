Used Car Price Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of used car listings to identify key factors influencing car prices. The goal is to provide valuable insights for used car dealerships to refine their inventory management and pricing strategies.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing for a used car dataset.
Feature selection using correlation analysis.
Implementation of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models to predict car prices.
Analysis of factors influencing car prices, including car age, mileage, car class, and other features.
Recommendations for used car dealerships based on the analysis findings.

This will execute the data analysis steps, generate a report with key findings and recommendations, and potentially produce additional output files (depending on your implementation).

Data

The used car data should be placed in a separate folder within the project directory data/. Ensure the data file is in a format supported by pandas (e.g., CSV, Excel).


The project provides a foundation for further exploration. Consider:

Including additional car features in the analysis.
Investigating market factors influencing pricing trends.
Developing more sophisticated pricing models.
